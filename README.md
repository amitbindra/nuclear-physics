# Nuclear Binding Energy & Grodzins Product Prediction

This project uses Python to predict nuclear properties such as `E(2^+_1)` and `B(E2; 0^+ -> 2^+)` using LightGBM models. The project also calculates the Grodzins product based on the predictions.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `lightgbm`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install them using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas lightgbm matplotlib scikit-learn
